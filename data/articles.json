	"content": "Winter Survival Tips for Outdoor Bootcamps and fitness Classes With the winter fast approaching we thought it would be beneficial to put together a survival guide so you can continue to enjoy your classes and be ready for best season for training!!Here is a winter survival top tip guide for boot camp classes; (We have used our own knowledge and experience as well a resources from third parties which have been referencedRealising the health benefits of exercise during winter:\n\n\tStaying cooped up indoors all winter isn't beneficial for your health and can leave you more exposed to illnesses doing the winter rounds. Getting out and about gives you a chance to breathe fresh air, to see new and varied sights (beats cabin fever), and gives you a sound mind and body workout.\n\tIf you suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), getting outside and exercising will help to alleviate the symptoms by introducing more daylight to your system and by involving you in activities that are fun and exciting.\n\tFor those trying to keep their weight under control, exercising in the cold burns more calories because you need to move faster and constantly to remain warm; as well, many winter sports require you to tackle different terrain, including snow.\n\tExercise can help keep colds and flus at bay, provided you don't overdo it.\n\nSkincare and Clothing\n\n\tGear up for the running. If you can, apply moisturizer on your skin to keep itching and dryness away. Invest in good ski-mask or hoodie that will protect your neck, head and face from bitter wind. Pull a knit or fleece cap over your ears and wrap a scarf around your neck and mouth if you don't have a ski mask.\n\tFind a lightweight but warm winter jacket for you to wear. These are usually fleece. Gear up under it with a t shirt (long sleeved or short sleeved) and a sweatshirt. Too warm will cause you to sweat after a few seconds of running.\n\tWear leggings and sweatpants, or long underwear and sweatpants.\n\tWear running shoes that have decent traction, so you can maintain traction on icy or snowy surfaces. Trail-running shoes work very well. If there is too much snow, try lightweight boots that bend with you but wick off snow and moisture. Our recommendations are some of the following:\n\tRemove sock liners and wet laces and hang them up so the sneakers can dry more quickly.\n\tStuff shoes with wadded newspaper to soak up the stink and moisture.\n\tPlace them in a warm, dry spot but not too close to theradiator: Heat breaks down the foam and rubber in sneakers.\n\tTip: Spraying your sneakers with a waterproofing solution can help them withstand the wet better, Luna says, but it can also make them less breathable.\n\nProtect your car\n\n\tThe likelihood is that you will be getting mucky! To protect your car we recommend car covers or bin bags. You can get 10 seat shaped car covers for £2.75 on the following link: http://www.amazon.co.uk/AllTrade-Direct-Premium-Disposable-Protective/dp/B00M0LPC0U/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1412678963&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=car+plastic+seat+covers\n\tBring a spare plastic bag for your dirty trainers and spare pain of trainers/ flip flops/ sandals.\n\nWarm up and cool down\n\n\tA good warm-up is essential to avoid injury, but it’s particularly important in winter when it can take a little longer for your body to warm up.\n\tStart slowly with some very gentle running or even walking. “One top athlete I used to train with always began with walking,” says Jackie. “‘What’s the rush?’ he used to say.”\n\n\n\tGradually increase your pace until, after around 10 minutes, you get to the pace you’re going to maintain for most of the run.\n\n\n\t“Don’t stop after your warm-up to stretch,” says Jackie. “Your body will cool down again and you’ll have wasted the time you spent warming it up.” If you want to stretch before you start running, you could do some walking lunges or high knee skips.\n\n\n\tTo cool down, carry on running at an easier pace or walk for five to ten minutes. This will help your body recover after your run. But don’t stop and stretch outside or you could get too cold. Do some stretches indoors instead\n\nNutrition \n\n\tWhen the temperature drops and winter arrives, it can become tempting to curl up on the couch with your favorite snacks while the kids play outside in the snow. During the winter months it's important to ensure that everyone in the family continues to eat healthfully. This can be especially tough around the holidays, but by following some simple nutrition tips you can keep your family fit and healthy while boosting your immune systems.\n\tDuring the cold, winter months, you may feel yourself craving more carbohydrates than usual. There's a good reason for this: with fewer hours of sunlight, the level of \"feel-good\" serotonin stored in your brain can become depleted. To compensate for declining serotonin levels, your brain tells your body it needs more, resulting in an increased craving for carbohydrate-loaded comfort foods that boost serotonin production. Your children will probably be feeling the same cravings, so it's important to help them avoid simple carbohydrates such as sugary snacks and encourage them to eat complex carbohydrates that will take longer to break down and provide a longer, more sustained level of energy. For meal time, think of seasonal foods; good wintertime sources of carbohydrates include pumpkins, squashes and sweet potatoes. Switch from sugar-laden recipes for these vegetables and try soup or casseroles seasoned with dry dressing and dip mix for an unexpected burst of flavour\n\n Vitamin DFewer hours of sunlight each day and colder temperatures that keep you indoors can result in your body taking in less vitamin D than it receives during the summer, which is generated in our bodies via sunlight. For this reason, you need to ensure that your family receives enough vitamin D during the winter. Sources of vitamin D include fortified milk and other dairy products, eggs -- especially the yolks -- and fatty fish such as salmon. However, food alone may not be enough to provide the vitamin D lacking in the winter. One solution might be taking vitamin D supplements to ensure you're all getting enough. Always speak to your pediatrician before placing children on any supplement, especially vitamin D. Too much vitamin D is also a concernBoost Your ImmunityThere's no surefire way to prevent catching a cold, but there are some steps you can take to minimize the risk. Vitamin C supplements, for example, have been shown to make colds milder and shorter. Another tip is to eat plenty of probiotics, healthy bacteria that can protect the body from infection. Probiotics are added to some brands of yogurt, a good food to include as a snack or for breakfast, or use it as a healthy base for vegetable dip made with dry dressing and dip mix. Another tip to help moms and kids boost their immune systems is to eat foods that are rich in antioxidants such as vitamin C and beta-carotene. These are found in foods such as cabbage, broccoli, citrus fruit, sweet potato and spinach. Increasing your zinc intake can also help you fight off infections. Foods rich in zinc include fish, poultry, eggs, milk and unprocessed grains and cerealsBeware of OvereatingBoth adults and kids have a tendency to overeat during the winter, and high-calorie, high-fat diets can have an adverse affect on immune systems. Nutritionists recommend eating no more than 30 percent of your calories as fat year-round, and they advise that the fats you consume should be healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturatedStaying Motivated\n\n\tIt's getting colder and we are losing the light, which doesn't help the motivation levels for training over winter, right? But if you're tempted to hit the snooze button in the morning, remember this – staying motivated this winter requires a change to only one thing: your mindset. Sure, the conditions encourage eating more and doing less, but the bedrock of motivation is based on two things. The first is having a goal or target to aim for. The second is clearly understanding the positive effects your actions will have on your life. Connect with these two forces and you will always be inspired.\n\nTrain for an event:There is nothing like having a short-term goal to work towards to keep you focused and on track with your training. The end of winter brings with it a few classic events, such as the body+soul Bridge Run in Sydney. Winter is the perfect time for running training, too, because it’s not too hot.Set a goalNot really into running? No problem! Set another goal, such as a few kilos' weight loss or a five per cent reduction in body fat. Stick a photo of that bikini you want to buy on the fridge. When you see that swimwear, knowing each day that passes brings you closer to hitting the beach this summer, you are going to be keen to close that fridge door and grab the skipping rope instead. There's nothing like a picture to motivate you. It might not be a bikini; it might be a photo of you in terrific shape or a great outfit you want to wear. Whatever image works for you, stick it up where you'll see it every day.Focus on the benefitsThe gravitational pull of the bed is very strong at 6am, especially when it is cold and dark outside. That's why you need to remind yourself of the benefits exercise brings you. You want to manage your stress levels, have an abundance of energy and feel good about yourself rather than falling asleep at your desk, feeling overwhelmed and overweight. So get a piece of paper and write down all the ways exercise adds to the quality of your life. Stick it on the fridge, along with your photo, and read it regularly, particularly when you are feeling flat.Embrace the weatherInstead of avoiding the cold, embrace it. The famously disciplined Shaolin monks train in any conditions because it builds character. You don't have to go to the Himalayan mountains, but getting outside for some fresh air and open space will be good for your mind as well as your body. If it rains? You need to toughen up and get wet - It wont hurt youReward yourselfWhen you reach your goal, reward yourself. Not with a big cake, but with something special like a new outfit for your new body. There's nothing like working towards a goal, achieving it, then splashing out to say: \"Well done me\".Checklist\n\n\tScarf, \"hoodie\", or ski-mask\n\tWool hat\n\tT-shirt\n\tlong-sleeve shirt\n\tSweat-shirt.\n\tSweat-pants\n\tLong underwear\n\tAt least two pairs of socks\n\tRunning shoes with good traction\n\tWarm gloves or mittens\n\tCar seat protection\n\tMOTIVATION\n\nWinter exercises to burn CalsBuilding a fire: 80 calories*Having a snowball fight: 96Ice-skating: 176Shoveling snow: 192Skiing (cross-country): 256Skiing (downhill): 192Sledding: 224Snowboarding: 192Referenceshttp://www.fitnessmagazine.com/workout/motivation/get-started/winter-fitness-workout-tips/#page=9http://everydaylife.globalpost.com/winter-nutrition-tips-24200.htmlhttp://www.bodyandsoul.com.au/fitness/training+tips/stay+motivated+to+exercise+over+winter,18065&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;",

Well here is UK Dietitian Nic from NicsNutrition.com to introduce you to what makes up a balanced diet!\n\"A balanced diet can be made up of the following food groups:\n\tFruit &amp; Vegetables, which provide our bodies with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, fibre and water. Fruit, vegetables and salad are low in calories and high in volume. Fruit contains natural sugar (fructose), which releases its energy slowly meaning it keeps you fuller for longer. The majority of vegetables and salads contain very small amounts of energy and so are great to fill up on, especially if you are trying to lose weight.\n\tHow Much Should we Eat? A portion of fruit is a handful, around 80g (40g of dried fruit though). Ideally you should eat between 5 and 9 portions of fruit and vegetables a day. Aim to eat a variety of different colours, which means you will be eating a variety of different nutrients and vitamins. Fresh, frozen, juiced, canned and dried fruit and veg all count, with the exception of white potatoes (sweet potatoes do count!). If you love 100% pure fruit juice, great, but limit your intake to one small glass a day as it’s not as good as eating whole fruit. For weight maintenance you should fill 1/3 of your plate with vegetables or salad, and for weight loss you should fill up 1/2 of your plate, with fruit snacks in between or as a part of your breakfast.\n\n\n\tStarchy Carbs, such as granary bread, basmati rice, porridge oats and pasta provide our bodies with energy, some protein, B vitamins, minerals and fibre. Wholegrain foods such as oats protect us against the risk of heart disease and stroke, and those that are higher in fibre and less processed also have a lower glyceamic index (GI) which means that they release their energy slowly.\n\tHow Much Should we Eat? At each meal i.e. 3 times a day, you should fill 1/3 of your plate with starchy carbs if you’re trying to maintain your weight and just under 1/4 of your plate if you’re trying to lose weight.\n\n\n\tMeat, Fish &amp; Alternative sources of Protein such as eggs, nuts, beans and pulses provide our bodies with protein, which enables our bodies to grow and repair. These foods also provide B vitamins, including vitamin B12 needed to make red blood cells and keep our nervous systems healthy, and minerals including iron, zinc and magnesium. We should choose leaner cuts of meat and healthy cooking methods such as grilling or dry roasting (minus the skin on meat!). Bulking out meals with ‘plant-based proteins’ such as lentils and beans will make your meals higher in soluble fibre which helps to lower cholesterol levels.\n\tHow Much Should we Eat? At each main meal i.e. 2 times a day, you should fill 1/3 of your plate with protein foods if you’re trying to maintain your weight, and just over 1/4 of your plate if you’re trying to lose weight (see below for more information on portion sizes!). We should eat at least 2 portions of fish a week, 1 of which is oily e.g. salmon, fresh tuna, mackerel, pilchards or sardines as they are rich in omega 3 which helps to keep our hearts healthy. They are also a good source of vitamin D which helps the body to absorb calcium. For more information about protein and protein powders checkout [this blog post].\n\n\n\tMilk &amp; Dairy Foods provide our bodies with protein, calcium, vitamin B2 (needed to turn the food we eat into energy) and vitamin A (needed for healthy eyes and also teeth).\n\tHow Much Should we Eat? Ideally we should be eating 2-3 portions of milk and dairy foods a day. A portion is the equivalent to 1/3 pint milk, 1 small pot of yoghurt or 30g (a match-box size) of cheese.\n\n\n\tHigh Fat/Sugar Foods such as butter, oil, biscuits, cake, sweets and pastry should be eaten in moderation. Foods high in fat and sugar are high in calories which may promote weight gain. Eating too many sugary foods can also cause tooth decay. Studies show that replacing trans fats (found in processed foods), with mono-unsaturated fats such as olive oil or rapeseed oil reduces the risk of diseases such as heart disease and cancer.\n\tHow Much Should we Eat? If a portion of fat/sugar is 100 calories, e.g. a tablespoon of oil/butter, 1 snack sized chocolate bar or 2 plain biscuits, we should aim to eat 0-4 portions a day.. fewer if you’re trying to lose weight as there are no nutrients in these types of foods that we cannot get from other food groups.\"\n\nFor more information on portion sizes check out Nic's Blog Post on Portion Sizes!",

This year, for the first time ever, bodyweight training appeared on the American College of Sports Medicine's annual survey of 3,815 health and fitness professionals predicting fitness trends for the upcoming year.\"Body weight training uses minimal equipment making it more affordable. Not limited to just push-ups and pull-ups, this trend allows people to get 'back to the basics' with fitness,\" ACSM wrote. No gym - No excuse.Energy DrinksEnergy drinks can be high in caffeine and Taurine. These drinks can give you sugar imbalances (Sugar highs and lows – meaning you will feel high then tired, high then tired). Energy drinks could be more likely to cause a caffeine overdose because they can be drunk quickly, unlike hot drinks like tea or coffee, they contain large amounts of caffeine which can cause heart palpitations, fits as well as raising the risk of Type 2 diabetes. These are extreme example but too higher consumption of these energy drinks are not good for your health. Energy drinks can also affect your sleeping pattern which in turn can also effect stress at work as well as lower concentration levels.Water, fruit and nuts can give you a longer lasting level of energy without the sugar highs and lows.Snacking at workReplace refine sugar and unhealthy snacks with healthier options.Here are a few examples of healthier snacks.

This will help you posture and strengthen you coreLast but most important, strengthen your back so it's as strong as your chest. These exercises can fix an imbalance.At the gym train your back not just your arms and chest (A better back = better chest). Overtraining your chest can tighten your frontal plane of your body, increasing the hunching and poor posture which we see every day in office desk based workers.Drink peppermint or green tea It is suggested that Green tea is the healthiest beverage on the planet. It is loaded with antioxidants and nutrients that have powerful effects on the body. Benefits can includes improved brain function, fat loss, a lower risk of cancer and many other incredible benefits. From personal experience peppermint tea has really helped with overall general health with a big favorite Pukka Tea (Licorice and Peppermint). Try these instead of coffee.Enter a mud run / Obstacle race course (ORC)Having a goal and focus is a great for starting up or continuing your fitness regime. It also brings camaraderie with all your work colleagues, and definitely creates a good vibe and positive chat. Some of the better races to enter – Total Warrior, Yorkshire Warrior, Yorkshire Mud Run, Spartan, Pain Barrier and Tough Mudder . These races are all held locally, bringing you lots of mud, obstacles and fun.General HintsThink positive and don’t- be drawn into negative conversions.

	"content": "Body Weight Training Why?1. Super-efficient workouts. Unless the goal is to look like Arnold circa 1977, the days of two-hour workouts are numbered. Research suggests high-output, bodyweight-based exercises such as plyometrics yield awesome fitness gains in very short workout durations. Since there’s no equipment involved, bodyweight workouts make it easy to transition quickly from one exercise to the next. Shorter rest times mean it’s easy to quickly boost heart rate and burn some serious calories.2. Combined cardio and strength training. Pressed for time but need to hit cardio and strength in one quick workout? Performing quick bodyweight cardio sessions (such as one minute of burpees or a set of jumping jacks) in between strength exercises will keep the heart pumping while still encouraging muscle and strength development. How to do a burpee3. Fast fat-burning. Looking to shed a few unwanted pounds? Just a few minutes of a bodyweight circuit training can have a major impact on the body's metabolism. Don't believe it? Try adding a few quick sets of these amped-up burpees into any workout routine and see what happens!4. Something for everyone. Bodyweight exercises are a great choice because they’re easily modified to challenge any fitness level. Adding extra repetitions, performing the exercises faster or super-slow, and perfecting form are a few ways to make even the simplest exercise more challenging. And progress is easy to measure, since bodyweight exercises offer endless ways to do a little more in each workout.5. Improved core strength. The \"core\" is more than just abs. In fact, at least twenty-nine muscles make up the human core, and many simple bodyweight movements can be used to engage all of them. Such exercises improve core strength for better posture and improved athletic performance.6. Increased flexibility. Not everyone who does regular resistance training has to end up with tight muscles, inflexible joints, and a bad case of imaginary lat syndrome. Bodyweight training for strength and flexibility can go hand-in-hand. Completing bodyweight exercises through a full range of motion is a great way to ensure joints are moving freely, can lead to improved posture, and might even reduce the chance of exercise-related injury. And yoga, the bodyweight-based workout of choice for many, is another great way to to improve flexibility while also significantly improving strength.7. Convenience. Ask someone why they don't exercise, and chances are \"no time\" or \"inconvenience\" might come up as culprits. Bodyweight exercises eliminate many of these common obstacles by allowing anyone to squeeze in workouts wherever they are. Exercising without equipment can be used as a stress reliever for those working from home or can provide a great hotel room workout for people on the road. \"No time\" really becomes no excuse.8. Better balance. Since bodyweight exercises use no weights, increasing resistance is accomplished in other ways. For example, a regular bodyweight squat can be ramped up by swapping it for a single-leg squat (known as a pistol squat). Super-functional exercises like the pistol squat (and less intense ones, too!) can improve balance through increased body awareness and control. These advantages are another reason why bodyweight exercises can improve athletic performance.9. Bye bye, boredom. There are countless exercise variations that can spice up any workout routine. Working with a variety of exercises not only relieves potential workout boredom, it can also help break through exercise plateaus to spark further fitness progress.10. Fitness that's fun! Heading indoors for exercise is not everyone's cup of tea. That's another beauty of bodyweight exercises: They can be performed inside or outdoors, alone or with a group of friends, which is particularly enjoyable if some seemingly silly exercises are incorporated into the routine! A little laughter makes the process more enjoyable.11. Injury prevention. Since injury is one of the main reasons why people fall off the exercise bandwagon, preventing those aches and pains should be a big priority. Bodyweight exercises are generally quite safe for any exerciser regardless of experience, age, or fitness level. Many simple bodyweight movements can actually be an effective option for rehabilitation, even for those with significant impairments.12. Results. Let's talk results. Bodyweight exercises get results partly because they often involve compound movements (meaning numerous joints and muscles are engaged in each move). Compound exercises such as push-ups, lunges, and chin-ups have been shown to be extremely effective for strength gains and performance improvements. The results from bodyweight training are amplified even more because of the core strength they develop (see #5 above). And research shows improved core strength gained through bodyweight training translates into improved strength gains throughout the entire body          ",

	"content": "Pre workout food - Advice tips and truthsWhat to eat before a fitness class?Written by Rob Maher (UK Outdoor Fitness)Why you should eat prior to a workoutThis blog post is to give our members a better understanding about what the right foods are to eat to optimise performance at boot camp and promote healthy eating to our members this winter and thereafter.Please note the right pre workout food is very important‘You should always eat food prior/pre workout something before a bootcamp class so your body has enough fuel to power through your workout.’Ignore the myths that starving yourself pre-workout will cause your body to burn more fat during your workout. This is not true, and can actually have detrimental effects on your body.  Not eating pre workout can cause your body to actually use more energy from proteins than fats (deriving from muscle mass). This counteracts the point of the workout, which is to increase muscle mass and get lean! Your body needs sugars to use as fuels. These sugars come from Carbohydrates making a small, healthy snack consisting mainly of healthy carbohydrates perfect for fuelling your workout.When you should eat prior to a workoutThere are no set rules for when is the best time to eat prior to a workout and it can vary between each individual, depending on the foods you are eating. As a general rule; for a large meal leave between 2 and 4 hours before exercising, for a medium / small meal leave between 1-2 hours before exercising and snacks (fruits) can be consumed between 0-1 hour before.30mins before workoutA snack consumed just before workout should be a fast-digesting carbohydrate that contains little fat. (Fat digests slowly, so you want to avoid this just before exercising.) This enables you to digest the meal quickly and assures energy is available during your workout.Pre Workout Snacks and food before a Bootcamp class\n\n\tFruit juice\n\tFruit smoothie\n\tHigh-glycemic fruits like pineapple, apricots, banana, mango, and watermelon\n\tSports drinks\n\tPretzels or bagels (but not whole grain varieties, which digest slowly)\n\tEnergy bars (look for 3-5 grams of protein, at least 15 grams of carbs, and very little fat)\n\n Banana is an excellent source of energy as well as many other health benefits2 hours before workoutAn ideal meal time is approximately 2 hours before your workout. This should be 300-500 calories consisting mainly of healthy carbohydrates. This is probably the most common method and it must be noted that the higher the fat and protein content, the longer you will need to wait before exercising!Meal Ideas before Bootcamp (1-2 hours before):\n\n\tGreek Yogurt and trial mix\n\tWhole wheat toast and sliced banana\n\tNuts\n\tOatmeal\n\tCereals (with more than 3 grams of fiber) and milk\n\tTrail mix with nuts and dried fruit\n\tHummus and raw veggies\n\tHard boiled eggs (or egg whites)\n\tCottage cheese and fruit\n\tHalf a peanut butter or turkey/chicken sandwich on whole grain bread\n\tWhole grain crackers with nut butter or cheese\n\tWhole grain fig (or fruit) Newton cookies\n\tMilk (especially chocolate milk)\n\tTomato or vegetable juice\n\tYogurt smoothie (with added protein powder, if desired)\n\tMost protein/energy bars\n\tBananas\n\nAs a moderate athlete there is a lot of flexibility available in terms of nutrition prior to workout. However it must be noted that food does need to be consumed prior to a workout and fasted workouts are counter-productive. It is about getting to know your body and what works best for you as each individual is different. Eating the right foods at the right times before your workout is essential for energy, performance and to keep your body burning fat!!\n",

	"content": "Shape Up over this Christmas period\nShape up whilst most people increase weight over the festive period, why not shape up?The Christmas period is notorious for people piling on a few extra pounds! The cold, miserable weather makes exercising less desirable and the festive period is filled with alcohol, buffets and Christmas dinner (&amp; pudding!!). This blog post gives some simple tips that will help you to stop adding on the pounds this festive period!Fun Fact: Research has shown that if you eat one mince pie every day from the 1st December, you will be one kilo heavier come the end of the monthThe Guardian suggest we can add on average 5lbs increase by the end of the Christmas periodTo start with you need to ask yourself ‘do I seriously want to watch what I eat and stay healthy and look good this Christmas season?’ If the answer is YES then this post will be beneficial for you! By far the most important factor here is your attitude and determination! Too often people are resigned to the fact that they are going to put weight on over the xmas period, but just a few small changes and a bit of self-discipline could change this.Here are the UK Outdoor Fitness top 5 tips for this Christmas period to stay in shape;KNOW YOUR GOALS – It’s the holiday season so undoubtedly you are going to be eating out more and consuming more rich foods. So the most sensible goal at this stage would be to ‘maintain your weight’. This way it will be pleasant surprise if you do lose some weight, but aiming to maintain at this stage is sufficient.STAY ACTIVE – You must keep up your exercise regime during this period. Do not wait to start your regime in January, it is not going to help with your weight loss. Start now and make exercise your priority. If you are going to a party close by; walk and do not get a taxi. Take stairs not lifts. Here are some key reasons why:\n\n\tImprove you immune system and reduce your chances of falling ill.\n\tPromotes a positive mind and attitude towards all aspects of life.\n\tReduces anxiety and stress (which can be high during this period).\n\tWinter is an ideal time to lose weight as your metabolism naturally speeds up to help keep you warm. Keep moving through winter and you'll be a step ahead when the warm weather arrives.\n\tSummer bodies are gained in the winter!\n\nDO NOT OVERSTOCK YOUR CUPBOARDS/ BE CARFUL WHAT YOU EAT – If the food is not there, you won’t eat it! Easy to eat snacks such as share size packs of crisps, sausage rolls etc. make persistent snacking too accessible. Limit the amount you buy and be strict with yourself. Ask yourself ‘am I really hungry or am I just eating for the sake of it?’ Be in control of your weight loss management. Another good pointer is eating a healthy meal or snack before you go to a party to stop you from over indulging on unhealthy party snacks.BE CAUTIOUS OF ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION – This is not saying you have to completely avoid alcohol. But definitely try to limit it and keep two or three days a week alcohol free. Drink lots of water in-between and after alcohol consumption to avoid dehydration. Also carefully chose the mixers you use, such as soda and slim line tonic. Try and avoid coke, lemonade and other fizzy drinks full of sugar! Also choose drinks with a lower alcohol content reducing the risk of ‘binge drinking’ and exceeding limits!EMBRACE THE CHALLENGE AND ENJOY IT – If you usually slack off in the winter, embrace the fact you are changing things this time around! Focus on what you do love about this time of year and focus on how it provides new health and fitness opportunities for you. Enjoy in season foods such as oranges, kale and chestnuts and enjoy some outdoor exercise in the crisp winter air! ‘Suck it up now, or suck it up come summer time’, easy choice As the winter is fast approaching, here at UK Outdoor Fitness we ensure sessions are adapted and made specific to the conditions to optimise results for all of our members. We LOVE training in the winter and we will make sure you do too!We have some great equipment to use this winter including;\n\n\tLighting for all parks\n\tTyres/ Sandbags\n\tResistance bands\n\tKettlebells/ Viprs\n\tBoxing\n\tWaterproof Speakers\n\n Don't Add the weight on over Christmas Shape up instead",

	"content": "Fitness Assessment\nFitness Assessment 2015 taken by Lee Parfitt The UK Outdoor Fitness Assessment assesses aerobic power and muscular endurance and comprises the following elements that must be completed in the order shown:a.            1.5 mile Run (Aerobic Test)\n\n\tPress Ups (Muscular Endurance)\n\tSit Ups (Muscular Endurance)\n\tBurpees (Muscular Endurance)\n\tShuttle Sprints (Speed Endurance)\n\nAssessment Protocols\nAssessment Activity 1Assessment activity number 1 is the Aerobic Assessment (Run), which comprises 2 parts.Part 1 of the test is a warm up for 5 minutes, during which all participants are to carry out their own warm up in preparation for the activity to follow..Part 2 of the test is a best effort run over a measured 2.4km course and follows on immediately after Part 1.The Aerobic Test (Run) is to be conducted on a 2.4km course on level ground affording a good running surface.Participants should be set off in order of ability groups with the lowest ability groups setting off 2 minutes prior to the higher ability groups. This should ensure that participants should be finishing the running assessment within a small amount of time from each other, thus minimising the length of time some participants are waiting prior to commencement of the next assessment activity.As each participant completes the run they are given a time, which they are to remember. Once all participants have finished the assessor should then collate all times from the participants.Assessment Activity 2Assessment activity number 2 is the Muscular Endurance Assessment which comprises of Press Ups, Sit Ups, and Burpees. Participants are to partner up, with one participant firstly carrying out 2 minutes of Press Ups whilst their partner counts them. After this the counting participant will then do the Press Ups whilst their partner counts. This should then continue through the Sit Ups and the Burpees. Carrying out this part of the assessment in this way ensures that each participant will have a minimum of 2 minutes rest in between each Muscular Endurance activity. The participant who is counting should only count repetitions carried out as per the following activity criteria:Press UpsParticipants are to lie flat on their stomach/chest with legs straight and feet not more than 30cm apart. Their hands are to be positioned, palms down (they may face inwards slightly) in a comfortable position from which they are able to commence the exercise. The hands and feet must be on the same level. This is known as the ‘Start Position’.The Press-up is performed from the Start Position by straightening the arms until they are fully locked at the elbows, using the toes as a pivot. The body is then lowered (by bending the elbows) until the upper arms are at least parallel to the floor. The body must be kept straight throughout the Press-up.Participants are required to perform as many Press-ups as they can within the 2-minute continuous period.Press-ups are performed within a continuous  2-minute period and participants continue with the exercise until the 2 minutes elapses or they are unable to continue due to the onset of fatigue. Rest periods are permissible as necessary and participants may adopt a rest position of their choice but they must return to the Start Position before resuming the test.Variations of this activity can be used if participants are unable to carry out the activity as outlined in the above criteria. These variations are Press Ups, pivoting around the knees or Box Press Ups. Participants using either of these variations of exercise should continue to use them during future assessments.At the end of each 2 minute Assessment, the assessor should collate all scores from the counters. Sit Ups Participants are to lie in a supine position on the floor with their knees bent between 70° - 110°; their feet may be up to 10cm apart. The arms are folded across the chest with the fingertips placed in the depression above the clavicle and elbows tucked into the chest - this position is known as the Start Position. The arms and fingertips must remain in this position throughout the test.The Counter holds the participant’s feet in place and the Sit-up is initiated, from the Start Position, by curling up to reach the vertical position, (ensuring the elbows touch the knees) followed by a return to the Start Position (ensuring that the base of the shoulder- blades gently touch the mat).Participants are required to perform as many Sit-ups as they can within the 2-minute continuous period.Sit-ups are performed within a continuous 2-minute period and participants continue with the exercise until the 2 minutes elapses or they are unable to continue due to the onset of fatigue. Rest periods are permissible as necessary and participants may adopt a rest position of their choice, but they must return to the correct Start Position before resuming the test.At the end of each 2 minute Assessment, the assessor should collate all scores from the counters. BurpeesParticipants are to stand up (starting position)to start the test, moving down to a crouched position prior to pushing the legs back, extending through the knees until in a press up position. They are then to bring the knees back towards the elbows prior to standing and returning to  the start position.Participants are required to perform as many Burpees as they can within the 2-minute continuous period.Burpees are performed within a continuous 2-minute period and participants continue with the exercise until the 2 minutes elapses or they are unable to continue due to the onset of fatigue. Rest periods are permissible as necessary and participants may adopt a rest position of their choice, but they must return to the correct Start Position before resuming the test.At the end of each 2 minute Assessment, the assessor should collate all scores from the counters.&nbsp;Assessment Activity 3Assessment activity number 3 is the 20 metre shuttle sprint. During this part of the Assessment, again the participants are paired up (ensure the same pairs as per activity number 2, with the same participant going first).One of the participants will then sprint out 20 metres on a marked area (preferably on concrete) and then sprint back. This is to be completed 5 times, ensuring that each participant has carried out a continuous 20 metre shuttle run, ten times.The partner is responsible for counting the amount of sprints that the participant has carried out.Once the participant has completed the Assessment activity, it is then the turn of the counting participant to do their assessment whilst their partner counts.&nbsp;",

	"content": "Summer Body - 10 steps to your summer body.\nWould you like a better summer body? Shape up for your holiday or just live a healthier lifestyle?\nUK Outdoor Fitness have come up with 10 steps to do this:1 - Hydration: Between 50-75% of our body consists of water making it key that we stay hydrated throughout the day, especially during the summer. Our body relies on water for a series of reasons such as cell life, chemical and metabolic reactions, transporting nutrients, regulating body temperature and removing waste from our system. We also dehydrate through exhalation and sweat. Increasing the importance of hydration during the summer period. Males should aim to drink 3 litres of water per day, 2.2 litres for women. More on hydration can be found at the link below:http://www.medicaldaily.com/7-ways-lose-weight-drinking-more-water-your-diet-247471 Drink and Hydrate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 - Sleep: As daylight increases so does the temperature: This can play a big part on our ability to sleep and recover both mentally and physically. Affecting how we feel and how we perform. Sleep is a key factor as is getting the right amount. It has been suggested that Adults should be getting between 7-8 hours sleep per night. Studies have shown that any less or more than this can make it harder for one to lose weight. Connections have also been made between poor sleep and obesity. Stressing the importance of a good nights sleep and sleeping pattern. More on sleep can be found at the link below:http://www.nhs.uk/news/2011/03March/Pages/sleep-and-weight-loss.aspx3 - Never skip breakfast: Many people believe that skipping breakfast will result in them losing weight as a result of consuming less food. However, this is not true. When we sleep our body is still active, resulting in the food that we consume throughout the day to be broken down in order to provide the required energy. Breakfast allows for us to replenish these stores as well as fuelling our body for the days activity. Skipping it causes for our metabolism to slow, burning less calories. This can lead to weight gain. More on the importance of breakfast can be found at the link below:http://www.livescience.com/39598-reasons-never-skip-breakfast.html4 - Get your 5 a day: We've heard this all of our lives and we hear it for a reason. Recent research shows that only 1 in 7 of us consumer 5 pieces of fruit or veg a day, but why? Fruit and vegetables are a great source of vitamins and minerals. Alongside a high source of fibre, key for maintaining a healthy guy and prevention of digestive issues. Also contributing greatly to a healthy and balanced diet. Whilst lowering the risk of obesity and other health problems. More on the importance of 5 a day can be found the at the link below:http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-133205/Fifteen-reasons-eat-portions-day.html5 - Ensure you're eating enough: As the temperature increases people tend to eat less often or not as much. As mentioned before, eating less often can slow metabolism and lead to weight gain. This is not ideal when trying to slim down for summer. Despite the weather it is important to consume the adequate amount of calories that your body requires for your fitness goals. Try to eat smaller meals frequently or a liquid based snack in between meals. More on summer food ideas can be found at the link below:http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-184206/Cool-foods-eat-summer.html6 - Alcohol consumption: With an increase in temperature social activities begin to occur in the forms of BBQ's and trips to beer gardens. Don't let alcohol get in the way of your summer body. Eating before you drink will make you feel fuller and can reduce the need to drink. Pacing yourself is also another way to ensure you don't consume too much. It is easy for many to forget that alcohol contains calories, making it easier to drink just as many as they eat. Be sensible with your consumption to avoid swapping that flat stomach for a big beer belly. More on alcohol, the summer and weight gain can be found at the link below:http://www.medicinenet.com/alcohol_and_nutrition/page3.htmhttp://lifehacker.com/this-infographic-shows-how-alcohol-contributes-to-weigh-16549228697 - Reduce sugar intake: Regardless of summer, fizzy drinks and those with high caffeine content are consumed. Simple steps can help to reduce your intake with options such as switching to a diet fizzy drink for instance or reducing how many teaspoons of sugar go in to your morning coffee. A high sugar intake can result in weight gain due to increased cravings and binge eating, potentially leading to more severe issues such as heart problems. More on the relationship between sugar intake and weight gain can be found at the link below:http://www.webmd.com/diet/20130114/sugar-excess-weight Reducing Sugar will aid weight loss&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8 - Avoid cravings, and find a healthy alternative: Finding yourself hungry in-between meals or craving something sweet? Don't sabotage your progress by cheating yourself and eating junk. Ask yourself if you're hungry or just dehydrated, the feeling of hunger can be mistaken as dehydration. Make sure you're eating enough at meals. However, if you do find yourself hungry throughout the day then try some of the options on the link below:http://www.rd.com/slideshows/stop-the-craving-24-healthy-snack-ideas/9 – Switch your transport: Make the most of the weather this summer and swap the car for a healthier method of transport. Simply walking or biking from place to place this summer is a great and simple way to stay in shape. This increase in activity can help not only strengthen your heart but also burn off that extra ice cream. Just one hour of moderate paced walking can burn up to 400 calories. Not only will this help you stay in shape but it’s also a great way to save money and help the environment. More information can be found at the link below:http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/loseweight/Pages/10000stepschallenge.aspx10 – Set goals and track your progress: With the nice weather people can find it easy to lose focus. Spending more time relaxing in the garden or at the beach and neglecting exercise. This could lead to putting on the weight which they worked so hard to lose. The use of goal setting can help motivate you and keep focused during the hot weather.

	"content": "Outdoor Trail Trainers\nUsing Outdoor Trail Trainers can help with safety in the winter, as well as improving performance for fitness and upcoming races.Below we have some information and suggestions to help you on the subject.\nWinter footwear\nAs the weather gets particularly muddy and slippery a number of bootcampers have asked about appropriate footwear.\nIdeally, you want to be looking at trail running shoes/ trainers, as they offer good support and a better grip.  Some people wear football boots, but we don't really recommend these as they can be dangerous during group games, and don't give the adequate support for the activities we take part in! Normal running trainers have great grip on Tarmac but none in mud, and the wetter unstable terrain that we have in the Winter. When wearing the wrong type of trainers, you may find yourself sliding about and in some cases cause your self an injury by tripping, slipping or twisting in the wrong way.\nThe benefit of trail trainers is that you can use them for Bootcamps, and then also in an obstacle race. You will find that spiked, studded or bladed boots are banned at races. This will make a pair of trail shoes a sound investment and will be there for you when you sign up to the trail, obstacle and mud races, such as Total Warrior and Tough Mudder.\nWhich Trainers to buy completely depends on your budget, your running style and the support that you need for your feet, knees and ankles; but there are great trainers out there to suit everyone's needs. Personally, I need to have a trainer with strong ankle support, as I have weak ankles. You may prefer waterproof trainers, a lighter weight pair or ones that allow your feet to breathe. It's all down to your own preferences.\nSuggestions to look at:\nBudget (£25-£30)\nAt the budget end of the spectrum are trail trainers by Karrimor. These can be bought from SportsDirect for under £30. There  are also some by a company called More Miles. A lot of people use the More Miles trainers in obstacle races, and people absolutely rave about them. You will find these at around the £25 mark. Both offer great grip and fantastic value for money.\nMid-range (£50-£65)\n\tAdidas Kanadia Range,\n\tAsics Fuji runnegade (Recommended for mud runs) These are deemed to be more running rather than trail trainers, but they are great for extreme conditions, and give better support as well as great grip.\n\nTop of the range (£60-£120)\nHere, the price can sky rocket, depending what you want for your money. You will find that you have a lot more options in this price range in terms of the colours that you want and the variability that you want from your shoes.\nSome of the most popular shoes in this price range are listed and reviewed below:\n\tBrooks Cascadia 4. - These keep out the rain but allow moisture. They offer great stability and is also eco-friendly\n\tSalomon speedcross 3 trainers have great grip, are light weight,  and come with a two year guarantee. A great blog on these trainers from the Red Wine Runner is particularly helpful, and advises that the Speedcross 2 trainers are excellent as well.\n\tSalomon Fellraisers\n\tASICS Gel-Fujitrabuco 3 G-Tx\n\nUK Outdoor Fitness Choice Inov-8 X Talon These trainers are Obstacle course approved, and are worn by many members of the UK Outdoor Fitness community. Please note though these trainers have a heel drop and you should be looking in to this http://www.inov-8.com/New/Global/Transition-Journey.html Jumping straight into using these type of trainers from heavily cushion trainers can aggravate or cause knee,ankle and calf injuries. Its takes time to get used to them (See link above) They are also not the best wearing on hard concrete or indoor surfaceshttp://www.muddyrace.co.uk/gear/212-talons/There are many other options that you can go for, which completely depend on your personal preferences. Prices vary from £60 - £120 as many companies do Goretex versions of their shoes as well as multiple colour options. You then get into the specialist shoes like the  Irock, and Icebug trainers, who all make specialist trail trainers and are widely used in obstacle races.When looking at trainers please make sure you check the following  features:\n\n\theel drop,\n\tweight,\n\tcomfort,\n\tankle support,\n\tfoot protection,\n\tstyle and cushioning levels.\n\nThe world is your oyster when it comes to trail trainers!!\nReviews\n\n\tRunners World Website \n\tMens Running UK \n\tOutdoor Gear Lab\n\tThe Independent \n\n(Please note this article based on recommendations from our trainers experience and research we have taken through third party websites, companies and personal blogs.

	"content": "Rapid Weight Loss - The Truth\n\"FAD diets and poorly controlled extreme weight loss course\"\nOver two thirds of the UK population is either overweight or obese. It is estimated that by 2030 this figure will rise to over 70%! In a time where we know more about our nutritional needs than ever, how can this possibly be the case?! Diets/FADS, food marketing companies, ever changing government guidelines, and people becoming increasingly lazy are the main contributors.  This short article will look at the dangers of common extreme weight loss/FAD diets which people are using for quick fix results.As tempting as it is to strive for results as fast as possible when trying to lose weight, it is not the way to go! In the modern day there are countless FAD diets encouraging rapid weight loss and whilst you may initially lose the weight, it can come with a number of health risks and it is not going to be sustainable. What is the point in losing 15lbs for you to put it back on as soon as you finish a diet which cannot be maintained for a long period of time?! FAD diets, crash diets of whatever you want to call them are money making schemes targeting vulnerable and often desperate people who are looking for an easy fix to lose weight. Think of the research you put into buying a new car or house – your body deserves even more attention!\nHere is how to spot a FAD diet:\n\n\tMagic or miracle pills\n\tLittle or no exercise\n\tRapid weight loss courses\n\tLimited ‘menus’ and good foods/bad foods\n\tShake meal replacements\n\tIf it sounds too good to be true\n\tStarvation diets \n\tliquid diets\n\tMeal Replacements \n\n \"Magic Pill\" diets do you really want this? Does that really look like fresh veg?We now live in a world where the question of ‘what to eat’ has become overly complex and people will often seek expert advice. The multi-billion pound food and supplement industry brainwashes people about the latest lab made product which comes with a whole host of health claims - Real food doesn’t need health claims. The food industry uses similar marketing tactics that the tobacco used to. Using catchy slogans to tempt people into purchasing - ‘A Mars a day helps you work, rest and play’ – yeah right! These sugary snacks, washed down with fizzy drinks and a microwave meal are in fact, in the long term, going to contribute to a number of potentially life threatening illnesses.\nSafe rate of weight loss\nIf you are trying to lose weight, a safe weekly rate of weight loss is between 0.5kg (1lb) and 1kg (2lb). To put that into perspective; 0.5 pounds of fat contains 1750 calories. So, to lose 0.5 pounds a week, you need to burn 250 more calories than you eat each day – this is easily achievable. In contrast, for a person to lose 4lb (14000 calories) in a week, they would need to burn an extra 2000 calories per day! To do this while providing your body with the required nutrients it needs is simply unachievable, hence the health risks.\nHere are some of the health risks associated with rapid weight loss.\n\n\tFeeling tired and unwell – This is often as a result of the low carbohydrate content in these types of diet. Your body performs best when carbs are available as a source of energy. You are also likely to be lacking in vitamins and minerals which can result in tiredness, fatigue, infections/colds. Medium and long term this can cause added problems such as loss of bone density and damage to the nervous system!\n\tUnsettling body processes - Rapid weight loss puts the body into a stressful, defensive state. The body tries to protect itself against weight loss by lowering metabolism, heart rate and temperature.\n\tGall bladder problems – People who lose more than 3 pounds per week have a substantially greater chance of getting gallstones than those who lose weight more slowly.\n\tLoss of muscle mass – This is a result of an inadequate protein and amino acid intake.\n\tWeight gain – You will rapidly regain the weight once you stop the diet. Your body will naturally need to restore the muscles and liver of the glycogen content that it has been missing!\n\nWhat to avoid:\n\n\tSeverely cutting down calories (anything below 1200) – If you lower your calories too much you will not be able to consume enough nutrients to fuel your body or satisfy your hunger. You will also lower your metabolic rate, causing a lower rate of energy expenditure, which is likely to lead to instant weight gain as soon as the diet is stopped.\n\tExcessive/Extreme Exercise – It can be the concept that the best way to go about weight loss is to significantly increase exercise frequency. This can cause tiredness, increase the risk of injury, wear and tear, and could take away the feel good factor associated with exercise. In more severe cases, it can even lead to damage to the heart. Stick to exercising 5 times a week for between 30-60 minutes, combining resistance, cardio and stretching.\n\tDiets that revolve around a single food (Special K Diet, Cabbage Soup etc) - Diets that revolve around eating one food severely restricts a range of other foods causing nutritional deficiency. This also leads to ‘diet fatigue’ and no matter what the food – dieters will be sick of the sight of it within a week!\n\tPredominately eating one food group (Atkins diet) - Avoiding carbohydrates or fats being the most common. Avoiding carbohydrates is essentially taking away food that your body needs to use as energy. This results in the body using proteins as fuel = lean muscle loss. Avoiding fats is also as dangerous as our brain and nervous system need certain levels of fat to function properly! Taking away any food group will be affecting a function of the body – don’t do it!\n\tPre-Packaged/ Processed/Takeout foods - Make your meals from whole foods as often as possible due to the high levels of unhealthy ingredients commonly found in highly-processed foods. These food sources are generally packed with additives and have high levels of trans and saturated fat, salt, sugar and contain very little nutritional value! Studies have linked processed meats, packaged meals, takeout food, and sugary snacks with higher rates of depression, stress, bipolar disorder and anxiety. If the ingredients list is longer your arm, it is almost certainly not good for you.\n\tCleanses/Detox Plans – A lot of this weight loss comes from water weight and can be dangerous! ‘Your body is uniquely fine-tuned to detoxify and excrete toxins. So cleanses are unnecessary and can lead to serious complications by messing with your body’s systems’.\n\tSupplements/Diet pills – Often under researched and dangerous! If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is! Stick to proven, natural methods of weight loss.\n\nAn in depth study found 83% of people who initially lost weight using FAD diets, went on to eventually show more weight gain than initially lost! DO NOT DIET, but change your lifestyle! Rapid weight loss is not SAFE or SUSTAINABLE! The fact is, as human beings we aren’t supposed to diet!! We are made to crave a variety of foods and our bodies will tell us when we are hungry. Listen to your own body and zone out the mass media and the photoshopped picture of the celebrity that you want to look like within two weeks, be patient and results will follow. Make small, permanent changes that you can live with until they become habit.\n ‘Small permanent successes will beat out massively ambitious failures 100 times out of 100’.\nHealthy eating is not about strict dietary limitations or depriving yourself of the foods you love. It’s about eating for enjoyment, to feel good, keeping your mind and body healthy. Where possible, prepare your own meals, always read labels, grill food instead of frying, plan meals in advance, never miss a meal and take your time eating to suppress your appetite. Eat a range of fruit and veg, aiming for at least 5 portions a day and limit your intake of trans &amp; saturated fats, simple carbohydrates (sugar), salt and alcohol. Don’t make a habit of using food as a comfort when anything goes wrong in your life! Use exercise as a stress relief, not a pack of doughnuts, and remind yourself that nothing tastes as good as looking good feels! Stick to a range of whole (1 ingredient), healthy and REAL foods which are predominantly plant based, control portion sizes, drink plenty of water and exercise regularly – There you go, a sentence that will in the long term, help you more than any diet on the market! You do not need Rapid Weight LossFor people who have developed bad habits over a number of years, this will not be easy, but what is easy in life? Embrace it and start loving food again!
